## About The Project

[![Grids Demo][product-demo]](assets/images/demo.gif)

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created for the Turing School of Software and Design's Module 1 final solo project. The overall goal was to demonstrate what we have learned after 2 months in the program.

The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html).
### Built With

* ![JavaScript][JavaScript-shield]
* ![CSS][CSS-shield]
* ![HTML5][HTML-shield]

## Notes

Planning documents for this project: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CoiL1VDHqBoSPtplJtX_yfX9O63XWgLtd8kR_6Rthu0/edit)

### Functionality includes...
- Switching turns
- Identifying a win or draw condition
- Reseting the game board 
- Tracking each players wins
- Switching the starting players turn at the beginning of each new game

### Wins

* I think the planning I put into this project from the beginning helped me visualize every element I would need and how it would all fit together
* What I enjoyed most about this project was learning about and applying all the smaller pieces that go into a well-rounded project (i.e. adding a license and pull request template).

### Challenges

* Trying to capture ever win condition without utilizing an array iterator was difficult, and the solution I came up with had a lot of nested for loops and conditionals

## Roadmap

- [ ] Utilize JSON and localStorage to save the game data locally so it persists when the page is refreshed
- [ ] Allow players to choose their token

### Collaboration

- If you would like to collaborate, please reach out by [email](press.matt14@gmail.com)
- If you would like to submit an issue or suggested feature, please `clone` a copy of the repository to your local machine, create a new `branch`, edit `suggestions.md`, and submit a `pull request` using  `pull_request_template.md`.
